                    <p>At Corporate Event Planner we come to work everyday because we love solving the biggest problem for business owners. Sometimes people don’t know what apps to build, how to monetize them, or even what to price them at. Advertisers &amp; brands don’t know where their target users are, how to reach them, or even how much they need to spend in order to do so. Investors aren’t sure which apps and genres are growing the quickest, and where users are really spending their time (and money).</p>
                    <p>Throughout history everyone has used data to help them make more informed decisions.</p>
